# User Guide

This document serves as a guide for using the Melody Generator application. 

---
## **Prerequisites:**

  1. **Java development kit (JDK)**:
   - Recommended version: JDK 23 is used in this project. However, you can also modify the version specified in `<release>23</release>` in the `pom.xml` file.
   - Ensure the environment variable `JAVA_HOME` points to the JDK 23 installation.
   - **Download**: [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk23-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/23/).
   - To check if the kit was properly installed, type the following in the command prompt or terminal:
```bash
java -version
```

  2. **Apache Maven**:
   - Maven is required to handle dependencies and manage the building. Additionally, it handles JUnit tests. 
   - Recommended version: Maven 3.8.0 or later.
   - **Download**: [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
   - To check if the Maven was properly installed, type the following in the command prompt or terminal:
```bash
mvn -v
```

  3. **JavaFX SDK**:
   - **Version**: 20 (as specified in the JavaFX dependencies of the `pom.xml` file).
   - **Download**: [JavaFX SDK](https://openjfx.io/).
   - Ensure the JavaFX runtime and SDK are correctly installed. To ensure that they are in your classpath, open the terminal or command prompt and write:
```bash
echo $PATH  # for Linux/macOS (JavaFX)
echo %PATH%  # for Windows (JavaFX)
echo $JAVA_HOME  # for Linux/macOS (JDK)
echo %JAVA_HOME%  # for Windows (JDK)
```

  4. **JUnit**:
   - If properly installed, Maven will automatically download JUnit (version 5.10.0) during the build process.


## **Running the program:**
   - Compile the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse) or a build tool (like Maven).
     ```
     mvn clean compile
     ```
   - Run the `MelodyGeneratorApp` class:
     ```
     java -cp target/classes main.gui.MelodyGeneratorApp
     ```
   - You can also execute the program directly from your IDE by setting the `MelodyGeneratorApp` class as the entry point.

## Understanding ABC notation:

- **Notes**: `C`, `D`, `E`, `F` `G`, `A`, `B`, and `z` for breaks.  `c`, `d`, `e`, `f` `g`, `a`, `b` are the base notes raised by an octave.
- **Flats**: We write flats by adding `_` before the note ( `_D` is D flat)
- **Sharps**: On the other hand, we write sharps by adding `^` before the note (`^F` for F sharp)  
- **Modifiers**: After the note add `'` for raising an octave (`c'` is C raised by 2 octaves), and `,` for lowering an octave ( `_D,` is D flat lowered by an octave).
- **Note lengths**: The number after the note multiplies the basic length by it. For an example, if the base length is 1/16, `C4` will be the length of 1/4.

## The use of different functionalities:

### 1. **Choose generation degree:**
   - Use the dropdown menu to select the degree of the Markov chain. 
   - To explain it shortly, if the degree is two, the patterns are being learned based on the two previous states. The higher the degree, the more context-aware and complex the melodies are. Higher degrees need more extensive datasets.

### 2. **Input Starting Sequence:**
   - Enter a sequence of notes (in ABC notation) to serve as the starting point for melody generation.
   - **Notice**: The starting sequence should have **the length equal to the degree chosen**.
   - You can write all of the possible notes, and use the modifiers in the forms of '() and ,
   -  Examples if the degree is 2:
     ```
     C C
     ```
     ```
     d c
     ```

Note: You do not have to use spaces in between, and are allowed to write multiple spaces, the parsing takes care of basically everything. Note lengths are irrelevant in this input.

### 3. **Specify Melody Length:**
   - Provide the desired number of notes for the generated melody. For example, entering `50` will generate a melody with 50 notes.

### 4. **Choosing the time signature:**
   - Pick a time signature you would like the melody to be generated in. If you are unfamiliar with time signatures, you can learn more about them [here](https://www.skoove.com/blog/time-signatures-explained/)

### 5. **Generate Melody:**
   - Finally, click the **"generate! :)"** button to generate the melody. The output in the text area below is the generated melody written in ABC notation.

### 6. **Play and Stop Buttons:**
   - Click **"PLAY"** to listen to the generated melody.
   - Click **"STOP"** to stop the playback.

## Training dataset:
 - The training dataset is the given text file [abc_data.txt](https://github.com/tricetvrt/AleksaTomic-Markov-Chain-Music-Generation/blob/main/ailab/abc_data.txt)
 - I have gathered a number of folk songs coming from the Balkans, Middle East, and other parts of the world with similar sounding folk music.
 - You are allowed, and incouraged to gather your own data, and choose your own genre you would like to explore generation with.
 - Ensure the training data (`abc_data.txt`) is in place and that the ABC notation melodies are separated  by `$$$`, which is used for handling the dataset in the program.

If you encounter any issues or errors, look at the implementation document for debugging possibilities or potential improvements.
